But no one said this major issue on every mac. If I touch or rub the mac body while charging, I can feel some electric sensation passing through my body.. when I searched about the issue, this issue has existed for the last 10 years on all mac devices because of 2 pin chargers without ground. This issue can be resolved only with a 3 pin charger with ground. This issue should be resolved by mac providing 3 pin charger but they didn't care about this issue. We should...

1,4,Value-for-money,"A bit expensive when we compare with today's intel (11th gen) or AMD (Ryzen 5th gen) based windows Laptops with RTX 30 Graphics but this Apple M1 in terms of overall performance, it is far beyond what windows laptops can offer in same segment.

I won't compare it with windows laptops as we all are aware of it. This is more about M1 chip. People are worried about buying M1 version because of compatibility issues.
Don't worry, this processor is so powerful and in terms of compatibility, this ...

First of all, I Thank Flipkart for the fast delivery, that too a day before the promised delivery date.
This is by far the best laptop you could get for the price range. As a person who have been a windows user all my life, MacOS is a totally different experience for me. The aluminium build, the performance, the display and the compactness of this machine has surprised me.

PROS:
1. The M1 Chip - This chip is the sole reason that narrowed me down to...

Was almost about to buy an 360 touch laptop for 65k,glad i changed my decision and bought m1 air as this is more value for money.
No complains for normal usage.
If most performance is needed, mbp with 16gb Ram wud be the best, which is 50k more.
Too bad selling it for 75k(999usd) could have been a great deal to buy."

Don't go for windows if you really want to
Windows is more flexible but mac is blazingly fast in everything !

It's a go to any business trip, school/college work machine which will last 12-14 hrs with hardcore usage
Video playback is around 13 hrs
With normal usage expect 18 hrs as promised by the company

Pros-

Way way better than Intel's version.

And battery backup is a killer.

Only issue is spending money on adapters as it has only thunderbolts.

Overall this machine is a beast."
34,5,Mind-blowing purchase,An absolute powerhouse. Very light in weight and processor is damn good compared to Intel chip. Also display is eye catching one. One should definitely go for this.
35,5,Fabulous!,Can't ask for more... Literally the best tech piece out there.... Performance... Battery... Sleek design... Portability... And specially after the discounts.. It was a no brainer.. Lack of ports maybe an issue but great dongles are available so anyone who needs a laptop at gif price point you should not think even if you're a pc user and get this.
36,5,Classy product,"Migrated from 2016 MacBook Air. Brand new, sealed pack product, authentic product was delivered by Flipkart. Transition from old laptop was very smooth. Best in class Laptop. Super happy with the Retina Screen, new speaker system, butterfly smooth key board, long battery life. Only thing that could have helped more is one USB port, I had to buy an USB type C to Type A extender separately."
37,5,Simply awesome,"Amazing laptop, super performance with M1, its blazing fast.
Audio is very loud, screen quality is brilliant, with these two watching movie experience is amazing.
Camera is decent quality, not great but still good. I dont use much camera so not a worry part for me.

This new M1 chip won't support some of the apps and software as it use to. But, for a general usage all the apps and software are optimised. I would definitely recommend this product for designers and coders you require a good processing power and battery life."
