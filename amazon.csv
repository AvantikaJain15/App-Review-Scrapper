,Star,Summary,Description
0,5,Mac M1,"1. Performance:
The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.

2. Battery Life:
One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.

3. Fanless Design:
The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.

4. Portability:
The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.

5. Compatibility:
The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.

6. Rosetta 2:
Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.

7. Price:
The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.

8. Integrated Graphics:
The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.

9. Limited Port Selection:
The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.

10. Upgradability:
The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase."
1,5,"Beautiful Machine, worth it for the money","I am a student using this laptop for coding, studying, entertainment, video editing, and 3D Modelling. Here are the pros. and Cons. I have noticed till now:
Pros:
-Everything works like a charm without slow downs
-I can have many things open without having to worry about ram
-It is quite (cause it doesn't have a fan)
-Super long battery life
-The simplicity and beauty of the mac os user interface (ui)

Cons.
-When doing intense work for long periods, it does heat up and there is no way of dissipating the heat apart from letting it sit idle
-When connecting a mouse to it via a usb-c dock, natural scrolling needs to be disabled for it to work like it does on any other computer, however, when using the trackpad, natural scrolling needs to be enabled for the same, there is no way to disable and enable it for mouse and trackpad respectively at the same time and needs to be done manually
-The camera quality could have been better
-For some reason the pinch to zoom function of the trackpad doesn't work as intended in apps
In all, this is a beautiful machine made with the intention of allowing people to do their work without much hindrance and is not made for gaming."
2,5,Very good product,"If you are college student you can definitely buy this item this will be worth M2 more expensive and same performance battery life is very good, display is bright and very good display and it is value for money you can buy it now problem
❤️"
3,4,M1 Chip is outstanding,Good performance and battery backup
4,5,Very good and proper packaging & amazing price,Good product and amazing price. Unopened pack from apple. Amazing display. Thank you.
5,5,Best laptop for portability and it is a performance beast ❤️,"I've been a life long a windows user-
I wasn't sure if I would be able to use macOS.
But in just 3 days I learnt it enough to get started. I have used it to learn data science projects and do coding python, sql, using tableau, vscode etc. That is 80%of my use case

Rest 20% is entertainment-

Pros-
Battery life is amazing, easily 10-12 hours if not more.
Very lightweight and good for bed use.
Never heats up or laggs, no need to shut down.
Always all my projects and codes are running and no lag what so ever.

Never used a laptop with better trackpad and gestures make life super easy.

Microphone and noise cancelation is superb, thanks to apple's technology.
Speakers are too good to enjoy and streaming content for hours without worrying about charging. Cracked apps also work for ms office if you want.

Cons- camera isn't 1080p if that is a priority.
I wish there was more ram but not a problem because of apple's memory swap technology.
M1 is faster than m2 for memory swap which is good for multi tasking. Or go for m3 if you can."

27,5,one of the best overall laptops for daily usage - just check reviews for this online,just check reviews for this online its unanimously brilliant
28,5,Quality and experience,Good and very nice prouduct
29,4,Worth the money !! Best laptop in this price range,"I bought it during sale and got it for 70000 and trust me it’s the best laptop in this price range , pros-
1). Build quality is too good and best
2) battery backup is very good and impressive
3) laptop is very much light weight and easy to carry even in single hand
4) the laptop does not have fan but still it does not heat much
Cons-
1) limited storage and no chances of upgrade , you need to buy ssd for extra storage which is quit expensive
2) less number of ports , it comes with only two usb c ports and you have to buy external port hub"
30,5,No 1 laptop,"No 1 laptop for business, management. i am using since jan 2022 of compony laptop. now i purchased my own one for designing"
31,5,I prefer to go Mac,"I'v been using windows since i grow up but when i shift into mac, I feel more comfortable to use that, about speed, accuracy and transition window mind blowing

Always prefer to Mac"
32,5,"Excellent performance, great battery","I got my product delivered earlier this week. My first impression was that it is thinner than I had anticipated, which is great. Looks sleek, but is very powerful. Though I admit I haven’t done much expect some streaming, browsing and document creation work, it has worked flawlessly so far, with absolutely no lag. I would say that despite only 8 GB, it would beat any 16GB, Core i5 PC hands down on performance.

The display is good though if you have used an FHD LED display, you may notice the difference, especially the black colour. But it is not a major issue.

The biggest advantage is the battery. After the first full recharge, I used it for around 14 hours before I charged it again with 24% remaining. This could be the single-largest attribute in its favour. The keyboard looks premium and keys are easy to use.

In summary, a great choice even in 2024. I would like to see how it performs on some light programming / compiling activities, but I am sure it will perform well there too. Very happy so far."
33,5,Best in segment!,
34,4,Very smooth,"It is really amazing macbook.
It handle multiple applications at once.
I don't say much in single word it's excellent product."
35,3,Does it have Microsoft office?,It doesn’t have Microsoft office
36,5,Still best in 2023 for developers.,"Writing review after 1 month of usage. I am a developer and purchased it for android and web development. while 8gb RAM sometimes may feel low but it doesn't make system slow. even if you are consuming 100% ram ( it does uses swapping like any other laptop does but windows laptop swapping is too slow) it doesn't feel like it is using swap. I use vs code, IOS simulator or android emulator, with bunch of chrome or safari tabs with backend server running with database and it doesn't feel like it's getting slow. everything works like you are using single application.
Battery backup is decent I am getting around 8-9 hours.

On the first time use it heated a lot. I thought the product has some defect. But after that it doesn't heated a lot.
Good in terms of keyboard, trackpad. I really loved the performance. Bought it during sale around 66k with card discount. If you are getting it below 70 go for it. Otherwise go with latest chips. M3 Air is also supposed to launch in the coming months. Wait for it.

Note: Good machine around 60 to 70k. If you have a good budget and looking for longterm laptop pick 16gb variant. SSD is fine 256gb is enough and you can use superfast external ssd's but ram cannot be upgraded later. So Consider upgrading ram if you are confuse in storage or ram."
37,5,best decision of my life,"kya chij h yar 🤤 , mza aa gya , sherrrrrrrr🫡"
38,4,Best laptop under 70k,"Best laptop under 70k, it has been 5 months of buying this laptop i find issue with stucking somewhere while using
Otherwise best productivity laptop ,
Sound and battery quality is best"
39,5,Simply loved it,"I bought this to laptop in place of ipad and it worth to buy Mac airbook than Ipad.

I dont play heavy games but this suits the requirement."

42,4,Macbook Air M1,"The overall experience is amazing. The packaging and all was too good. I got it for 70k during 2023 amazon great indian sale. I couldn't get the card offer and the sale price for the prime members on 7th oct was 63k which would have been a great deal. But i could not get it. I have even seen people buying this product for less than 60k on the early access sale days. So please keep that in mind. So i bought it for a much higher price. If anyone is thinking of buying macbook air m1 then please purchase it, if its less than 65k on sale or something. More than 65k would not be great for this machine in 2024."
43,5,This is awesome,"I am writting the review after using it 2 months
Good things
1. It is very fast
2. Its finger sensor it aslo very fast
3. It is very light weight
4. It is easy to travel with it
5. It is unbeatable in performance
6. It is fully metal body
7. Its metal finish is awesome
8. Its look is awesome
9. Its 8gb ram works more efficient than 16 gb ram of other laptops
10. If you are a student want it for coding then just go for it

Bad things
1. In base variant It has very less storage and it is also not upgradable after purchase. And if your try to get 1tb storage before purchase it will cost extra 40000 which is very expensive so you needs to buy a external ssd or hdd.
2. It has only 2 ports so you also need to buy a connector which will allow you to connect more things
3. it's screen catches dust very quickly so you need a anti dust screen gaurd for it"
44,5,Bittersweet experience,"This is my first Macbook. I needed a personal laptop with the following requirements -
1. It should have long battery life. I should spend less time being anxious about battery and more time actually focusing on doing some work with it for long hours. This device makes you forget worrying about battery.
2. It should wake up quickly/instantly from sleep, like how a tablet feels always ready to use. Imagine a situation when a question pops up in your mind that you've been encountering for long and thought of bookmarking it or letting it's tab sit on your open browser session, in such moments a mere 5-10 sec wake time will make you hesitant to reach your laptop, specially if ideas keep springing in your head multiple times a day. With Macbook, you open the lid and you're productive already!
3. It should be fast while multitasking and switching tabs.

I was initially skeptical with the 8 GB RAM thing, having experienced how quickly 16 GB fills up in windows with multiple browser windows and tabs open. Still decided to give it a shot, and man this thing doesn't disappoint.

But it's not all perfect. There are multiple issues I faced -
1. Using an external 2K 24-inch display delivers pathetic experience. The rendered text is unpleasant to read and the icons sent are not retina versions, they look bad. Having been spoilt by the excellent ClearType on Windows and noticing minute visual details by habit, I have a very bothersome time everytime I wake it up. Dear Apple, please provide subpixel rendering or a ClearType equivalent, it's much needed. Though at present, there are some software workarounds that could help to an extent by rendering retina visuals on non-retina displays, for eg. BetterDummy (supports M1).
2. The mouse pointer is annoyingly jittery. My setup goes like this - Lenovo Q24h-10 connected via USB-C to MBA, one USB port of the monitor's USB hub connected to Lenovo 300 FHD webcam, the other USB port (with support for USB BC spec) connected to an ORICO 4-port USB 3 powered hub (the external power is not connected though), and the wireless dongle of Dell KM636 connected to the hub. The setup works like a charm with Windows on a Dell Latitude, even with Samsung Dex, but somehow with the Mac, the mouse cursor is very jumpy and the experience is annoying to the point that it's unusable. Things are better if the dongle is connected directly to the other USB C port of the Mac though, via an adapter. They are also somewhat better after enabling some option related to power on the monitor's OSD, and using MOS software on Mac, but the jumpiness is still present.

Rating it 5 stars for what it's designed to do."
45,5,The best 👍🏻,"Very good laptop, value for money easily connect with ur iPhone, and very easy to use."
46,5,"the best laptop, period.","the macbook air m1 is the simply the best laptop one can buy, i used both dell inspiron and hp pavilion gaming, but the experience which im gertting is mind blowing. I want to point out that the display quality and sound quality is miles ahead of any other laptop in this price range but my favorite feature is 'instant switch on'. I wont go back to windows laptop now"
47,5,Mcbook air space grey is perfect to use,"It's a great laptop for office work, The screen size has become more compac then the earlier mcbook air , Good speaker in the side. The skype goes on a sleep mode along with laptop and the application to be restarted."
48,4,"Product good, Amazon festival dissappointing",Product is great. Ordered during Amazon great Indian festival! the ordered failed multiple times. Now it finally delivers altho at a higher price.
49,5,Got it for a banger of a deal.,"I bought this laptop for a steal price of 70K Flat. Delivery was within one day, all legit packing , warranty and works like a beast. It’s almost going to be 3 months - battery life - around 7 hrs if you are going to do solid work straight.
Overall - Highly recommended to buy in 2024. Unless the M2 comes down , this laptop is a steal but only if it’s under 70K!"
50,5,Elegant design with great performance,"This is a one another great product from Apple.

But, connecting with a hard drive it becomes very slow for me. Except this one issue everything is superb."
51,5,amazing must buy,got it for 63 k ! great deal for such a great laptop would buy even for one lakh not he best for gaming but great productivity laptop however if you have a slightly higher budget i would suggest buying m2 air or m2 pro but this is the best laptop and cheapest apple laptop you can get in the annual sales
52,5,Vry premium,Ultimate product
53,5,Excellent!!,Excellent!!
54,5,"Great MacBook, but packaging and handling could improve.","I recently purchased the new MacBook from Amazon during Great Indian Festival and I must say, the device itself is outstanding. The sleek design, powerful performance, and vibrant display exceeded my expectations. It’s a true workhorse for any professional or creative tasks.

However, I was slightly disappointed with the packaging. It could have been more secure to ensure the safety of such a valuable product. There were minor dings on the box, which made me a bit anxious about the condition of the MacBook inside.

Additionally, I’d like to address the courier service. While prompt delivery is appreciated, it’s crucial that the handling of delicate electronics be done with the utmost care. I believe a bit more attention during transit could prevent potential damage.

Despite these concerns, I’m thoroughly satisfied with my MacBook purchase. It’s a remarkable machine that delivers on all fronts. If the packaging and handling are improved in the future, it would make the overall buying experience even more exceptional."
55,5,Pocket rocket this Laptop is,"I upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).

Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.

Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.

Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.

OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.

Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.

Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?"
56,5,nicest thing I have ever bought,best thing for you in terms of every aspect if you don't do gaming
57,5,M1 8gb vs 16gb confusion?,"Should i buy the 16gb ram from apple store? This was the question i had for a long time. After going through tons of videos that compares 8gb air vs 16gb there was a clear evidence that with my use i can still be happy with the m1 8gb ram variant.
This is not a long term review but i shall update the review after few months of usage.
Why i opted for 8gb ram?
My use is browsing some secure pages, maybe watch some videos too. Use imovies to edit small videos (not heavy 4k long videos as such) but i have seen that this can support even editing 4k videos. But then definitely if you are someone who use it majorly for editing 4k videos then you should probably get the 16gb variant. Then i do a little bit of coding too.
I do have a office laptop that is a 16gb ram intel one. I did try opening some youtube 4k vids in chrome and compared it side by side and initial impression is pretty good on how the m1 takes on the load. But I should wait for more to get the actual picture.
So, if you are light user with basic use and not into gaming or anything. This laptop is gonna be more than enough for your use. As its very much portable and light weight. The battery is also heavily optimised. ( i tried all these and i am yet to do my initial charging 😊).
I shall update my review after 3-6 months for a better comparison.

***update after 10 months *****
No regrets! This is super fast engine. I do a lot of coding now with this. I feel every software works like a charm in M1 now. Of course we have the updated processor now. This is a start of a super powerful engine"
58,4,Damage in boxing,"Everything is fine, bt the original amazon box was in a disastrous condition, with seal broken down, with the opening of the box torn apart, yes the laptop and the apple box was safe, bt this habit of dealing with box which contains costly electronics is bad, I'm giving you 4 stars for the same reason, otherwise 5"
59,4,Got a great deal on Amazon,Thanks to the Amazon Sale I got this Macbook Air laptop for ~50k (after exchanging my old Macbook Pro and availing Bank discount). The same is available in the market for 80k before discount. However note that a) you don't have USB slots in the laptop and hence you have to buy USB dock separately and b) try not to use the 2 pin plug since it may give you slight electric shocks. Rather use the 3 pin plug adapter that is also available separately. When you buy a Mac be prepared to shell out more for add ons.
60,5,M1 MacBook Air ( total value for money ),"This is a one of the best MacBooks for its price. It’s got the M1 chip and it’s a lot more powerful than you think. This computer should be more than enough for about 90% of the average users. I’ve also got the old intel based MacBook and i can tell you without a doubt that this M1 MacBook Air is so much faster in terms of performance and what’s more impressive is that it’s also fanless. So if you’re in the market for a new MacBook, I’d say go for it. You won’t regret it."
61,5,This review is for software Engineer,"Writing this review after 3 months of use and there is no issue with product
I am software engineer earlier working on windows and switched with mac and I can say it was good decision for me.
I can able to perform high end task with good speed and performance.
I got it at 63000 In Offers
I bought it for performance and longer battery it is
Beyond my expectations and got it at really good price.

Thank you Amazon 💕"
62,5,Beautiful 10/10,"Won't recommend it at 80k but at 60-65k it's a steal.
Mfg - Aug,23, battery 100%, warranty- 1 year.

Perfect system for me, I needed a lightweight, long battery, less heavy charger cause I am 14 hours out of the house and I needed a system with no bottlenecks on battery.

This isn't for gaming, this is for light weight video editing and coding, which are my needs.

So overall 10/10 from me.

No scratches/dents etc. Like some complained.

DON'T PUT PLASTIC CASE AND SCREEN/KEYBOARD PROTECTOR ON IT. Will ruin that premium feel and functionality. [Just buy a sleeve]

Screen is super delicate, so better stop being clumsy while handling this because Mac is 65k and screen repair is 40k"
63,5,The best laptop better than windows in this segment,"Very nice product but there is a con
The m1 screen can break even with a single chips very fragile display 🥶 but overall the aluminium build is strong"
64,5,Satisfied and happy,"As Laptop or any electronic item should be bought keeping in mind the requirements.

I have used it for mainly study purpose and video streaming and I so far after using it for 20 days I am very happy and satisfied with the purchase.

The main highlights that I love in it are -
Battery performance.....as you know it depends......I get around 14- 15 hrs usage.....I have not calculated it but i am pretty sure.

Display......viewing angles are amazing and immersive experience

Charging....charges from around 20-90 in about 1:15 hrs
Finger works pretty fast and
Its auto adjustment feature when exposed to light or dark is also very helpful.

Talking about flaws.....its not like it doesn't have any flaws but none of it seems to bother me to the point that I have to rethink about my purchase."
65,4,Good battery life and RAM management,"Got it for 80K in last sale after all discounts combined. Received securely packed, and brand new no issues there. Here are some pros and cons you may want to consider:

1. Wonderful battery life: Most amazing feature of this laptop - can take it outdoors, with full screen brightness, and heavy workload (heavy programs running with 7GB / 8GB RAM used), it gives 8-10 hours or even more (haven't tried sitting all day outdoors).

2. Great screen: Better than my Mi notebook pro, that too has good screen, but this one is brighter and crispier and the difference is well noted in bright sunlight.

3. RAM management: I run chrome with 8-10 tabs open, heavy programs running that takes 14GB / 16GB RAM in my Mi notebok pro, this one manages it with 7GB / 8GB RAM. That's all. I felt some lag opening photoshop, 2-3 seconds delay clicking open button and actually opening of photoshop application, but I don't mind it. Comparing processing with my Mi notebook pro i5 with 16 GB RAM, this one is comparable.

4. Light weight and slim: At cost of slightly smaller screen.

Conclusion: This tool will get you through your general and programming needs with mac os."
66,5,Highly recommended,"Mac is Maç 💯!
If You are going to buy a laptop worth 80k+ go for it No one can beat it from design, battery, performance,speakers.
I really liked the user experience and overall performance here some points
1. I never heard this type of loudness in speakers of any laptop
2. Built is awesome
3. Work like a charm
4. You will never face a Lag
5. I opened 30+ Chrome tabs with git, terminals never faced an issue.
6. 2k Display is just awesome
7. Its main component is its trackpad what a smooth performance like you are using a touch screen phone
8. Keyboard is just awesome no one can beat in this
price range
9. M1 chip is just awesome and powerful.
Overall worth of money 💯."
67,5,Nice in every way! Go for it,"It is my first mac and i have been eyeing it for quite a while now and with the discount. I decided to go for it and it is extremely nice,, from the box appearance it is very minimalistic and the macbook is not too heavy and thin and easy to maintain. It is quite different from windows so you will have to get used to it but with a little tutorial from YouTube nothing majorly difficult.
The battery is very good, much better than I expected
The performance of the mac is also very smooth
Since it is M1 chip it is very fast while turning it on and off as well
The packaging is also spot on. Very good
There was 7 days replacement from Amazon but it was no need"
68,5,worth to buy,superb battery backup and smooth working

70,5,Best Laptop at this price segment,"If you are paying for this, apple is giving you that service too...

Pros -
1. Battery Backup
2. Speed
3. No noise bcz of not having fan
4. Low price in sales

Cons -
I don't think there may be any cons for this laptop, if u r thinking that screen size is small... don't wrry dude, i also switched from windows laptop and i don't feel any difficulties, even it is more comfortable than those laptops."
71,4,"Stellar Performance, Slight Hinge Issue","The MacBook Air M1 impresses with powerful performance and exceptional battery life, meeting high expectations. However, a tight hinge creates a feeble mechanical noise when opening and closing. Hoping the default warranty covers this without additional cost. Overall, a top-notch device despite this minor issue."
72,5,Worth the price,"Just love it. i am very much opposed to having iphones because its overpriced for its utility. But macbooks are just the opposite, there is no other laptop remotely comparable to macbook air. I got it for 62k inclusive of 1 yr extended warrenty. Best price"
73,5,Excellent Machine under 70K in 2023🔥,"I had used Windows for more than 8 years. Recently, I moved to Mac for the first time, It is amazing! It's Screen Quality is Top Notch because of the P3 Colour Gamut- A Wide Colour Range, It's very Beginner friendly-easy to use. Performance is the most highlighting factor for this laptop, Although It has sexy thin looks but M1 is top of the line. Battery easily crosses more than 8 hours. One Major issue I had faced regarding the File Transfer between Android to Mac or windows to Mac, It's very complicated thing! Otherwise, you can do! You need several adaptors for it! Anyways, I would say in 2023, MacBook Air M1 under 70K, Just go for it! Extremely value for money."
74,4,"APPLE M1 2020 IS A GOOD LAPTOP AS A HARDWARE PIECE, BUT SOFTWARE PLATFORM SUCKS.","Apple Macbook M1 2020 edition is an excellent piece of hardware bundle but the software platform is not suitable for many of the applications which work only on Windows PC. If and if only Apple sells its Macbooks for Windows operating system, it would be really a 10 STAR device.
Pros:
* Excellent SOC (System on chip) which is beyond any comparison. Intel and AMD have been left miles
beyond. Their processors are antiquated & far short in performance.
* The processor does not generate any heat - which indicates the cool operation and also low power
consumption. There is no cooling fan in the laptop. The entire unit is sealed as there is no heat venting.
* Battery lasts very loooong, even for HQ 16 K video playback.
* Display is very realistic with true colours.
* Sound quality is great. Channel separation is so good, you feel theatre like effect with sounds
coming from all directions, far and near.

Cons:
* Very poor or no scope for expanding the RAM and storage size.
* Software is expensive.
* Additional compatible peripherals are mighty expensive.
* Such pricey laptops come with only 1 year warranty.
* Other than 2 C type ports and a earphone jack nothing else is present. One C port is engaged for
power supply. Thus one has inflexibility of having to do with only one H.Speed ""C"" type USB port.
* Windows users switching to Apple are cautioned. Compatibility, storage space, expandability are
severely constrained.

Finally, like the PC's which can take MS Windows OS and also other OS platforms, Apple range of MacBooks should also be compatible universally for all platforms, with hardware expandability options like PCs.
with any Operating systems."

78,5,Got this in Just 63k - (3K amazing credit card cashback),One of the best laptop you can get in this budget and it is just a beast.
79,2,Rotten Apple!,"Just looks good and has a Apple logo.
Very poor camera, bad sound, hazy display, hangs and heating issue.
Pathetic performance.
Games aren't even loading properly.
Worthless.
Bad brightness and very bad battery.
Poor charging"
80,4,Original Master Piece,"I like the sleek design. Mac layest OS was upgraded. Was worried about being fake or broken but this was original model verfied through serial number. Keyboard Backlit, Amazing sound and display. Charged fully took 1-2 hr and so but is working amazing."
81,5,Gift For Kids,"Thanks Amazon..!

It was good experience all together starting from choosing the product and followed by payment and delivery within 48 hours.

Price and additional discount made this possible. Kids are happy, my daughter made सतिया on front face and my son made ॐ।

The first screen was showed to Lord Shiva and kids made call to their Grandfather 🙏

Kids played ॐ कर्पूरगौरं करुणावतारं संसारसारम् भुजगेन्द्रहारम्। सदावसन्तं हृदयारविन्दे भवं भवानीसहितं नमामि ।। on YouTube to check sound quality and they loved it.

Lastly we checked charging device and both (Adaptor & Cable) were working fine.

Amazing experience ✌️"
82,5,brand says it all..,"Worth every penny.. got in lesser price in Great Indian festival.
Sleek design.. smaller display but excellent quality
charger is good
light weight
everything is in C Port(cant connect USB, pen drive, speakers etc... need to buy extra accessories for connecting these)
Speaker is loud
everything is good..
Go for it if you want to experience different OS
The outer packaging(amazon) got damaged may be during the transit (should've handles with utmost care).. almost afraid to open it, but Mac book packaging inside is good and no damage.. Hope packaging gets better in future for these types of products.."
83,5,Longterm review Fanless Wonder,"I had fears about getting a laptop with passive cooling, even though I don't do video editing or compile big programs on the Air, even for web development and writing small scripts a fanless laptop seemed like a bad idea but after using this I can this thing is totally fine and wonderful

Docker works fine some issues do come up but for simple development of C++, Python apps along with Postgres SQL docker with some configurations the M1 chip has so far caused no issues.

I run vscode, pycharm the project is not too huge but with safari or chrome running with 6-8 tabs this wonder does not heat up or cause any instability.

The display is the best I have used so far, the speakers are far better than equivalent windows laptops

Some Cons:

1) No simple keyboard shortcut to control keyboard backlighting,
2) As a long-term windows user, the shortcuts like arrow key + Win key to resize apps/stack apps is something I truly miss, Mac does have its own multitasking/split screen way but I prefer windows installing a third party for this seems unnecessary
3) Battery life on 12.4 is a bit less than when I got the MacBook Air
4) Switching to Mac shortcuts takes a bit of time
5) Need to buy a type C Dongle, as I work of ethernet port mostly"
84,5,"Premium, Authentic, Epitome of perfection.","Premium laptop with all the premium features, I purchased this laptop for 64k in Great Indian sale offer, I was bit skeptical on the apps and software as I am new to the MacOS, I installed MS office and other apps from outside, everything is working well in this laptop. It is the best Laptop for this price now. Very comfortable and user friendly laptop. However if you are searching for something basic go for HP. If you are looking for premium product buy this Laptop."
85,4,Superb laptop,"Quality comfort sound quality appearance

Paid 59K. Worth laptop and smooth operating.

Camera quality very low. Atleast should have 3MP camera."
86,4,Better then expected.,"What a nice feeling, this is my first experince of Mac, after years of using windows finally I feel glad to get introduced to Ma, it is like a man living on earth has entered into Mars... Thank you Amazon."
87,5,Totally worth the money.,"Ideal laptop for office / personal use except gaming. No lag, no hassles, great battery life, lightweight and sleek and looks like a charm.

Perfect device for customers who are not into extremely heavy editing and gaming."
88,5,Awesome,Nice product satisfied
89,5,But laptop under 70k if you are not a heavy gamer,"I think at this price point the quality that Apple delivers that’s unbeatable,other windows laptops built quality that they can provide at this price range is average, you can play games on this laptop Apple has lunched arcade games like asphalt, evil dead ,metro horizon, gta 5 this laptop is best for students because it’s provide everything that you need overall all just go for it if you want a long term performing and value for money laptop"
90,4,Worth it,Worth every penny if you get it in a sale of 70K or less
91,5,overall experience is good,"battery backup is very impressive it lasts for 1 day on normal usage and it take about 3 hrs to charge 100% and about 60-90 mins to 80%. built quality is decent (not metal body) smooth experience for coding and editing. portable easy to carry. no heating issues(heat up while charging and heavy use and it's cools down in few minutes)

not much recommended for gaming
smaller as compared other laptops(not an issue)"
92,5,Best laptop,"I have been using Macs since 2009. They are the absolute best... sturdy , reliable great battery etc it's the same with this mac air too.. it's a sep 2023 manufactured Mac air"
93,4,Excellent product in this price range.,I am satisfied with the amazon service and apple product but only issue i found that the charger get heat up in 15 min of continuous charging.
94,4,Every thing is good,Port should be incressed or the company should provide option to the customer to buy an extra type c hub
95,4,Mac,"Amazing product, work very smoothly"
96,4,Nice product,All things are ok you get a genuine apple product . A nice and safe delivery but their is one thing bad in the invoice their is no serial no. Of the product so this can be a hurdle in claiming warranty in future .. thats the only one thing otherwise the best deal you get
